        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Made with beef, chicken, goat, or no meat at all,
            Kenyan pilau is a rice-based specialty that is popular along the Swahili coast. 
            The dish consists of rice that is flavored with a variety of spices and cooked in a broth made from meat or fish.
            Typical spices include ginger, garlic, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, and fried onions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This pilau variety is traditionally prepared and served for special occasions and celebrations.
            It can be enriched by the addition of potatoes, tomatoes, and raisins.
            Originally, pilau was brought to Africa by the Arabs, and later on, it was brought to America by enslaved Africans.

            <li>5- 6 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>300 grams of beef cubes</li>
            <li>2 cups of onions finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup of grated carrots</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of chilli powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of pilau masala</li>
            <li>2-3 bay leaves</li> 
            <li>5 cups of hot water</li>
            <li>1 cup of basmati rice(150gm), rinsed and soaked in cold water</li> 
            <li>1 tablespoon of coriander powder</li>
            <li>1 garlic bulb, cut the top off to expose the cloves of the garlic</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Take a large pot and heat oil in it.
                Add the beef into the oil in batches as we do not want to overcrowd the pan. 
                Cook the beef for 3 to 4 minutes until it turns brown on both sides.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chopped onions and stir for another 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Now add the chopped carrots and add all the spices (salt, pepper, chilli powder, pilau masala, and the bay leaves). 
                Stir for another 4 to 5 minutes till the carrots turn soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now add 3 cups of hot water to the mix and cover the pot with a lid. 
                Let it boil for about 45 minutes to 1 hour as we want our beef to become tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                After 45 minutes, check for the beef tenderness and then layer the rice on to the beef. 
                Add some more salt and pour another 2 cups of water to cook the rice. 
                Again, cover the lid and let it simmer for another 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now, open the lid of the pot and season the almost-cooked rice with coriander powder. 
                At this stage, push the garlic bulb into the rice making sure that the exposed cloves are submerged in the rice.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the lid again and let it sit for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now, open the lid and remove the bulb of the garlic and the bay leaves from the cooked pilau.</li> 
        </ol>
